# Bag-of-words model - Wikipedia
# Let's suppose there are 2 sentences below
# (1) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.
# (2) John also likes to watch football games.

# You can tokenize above 2 sentences,
# and put tokenized words into bags,
# then it will seem like below
# [
#     "John",
#     "likes",
#     "to",
#     "watch",
#     "movies",
#     "Mary",
#     "too",
#     "also",
#     "football",
#     "games"
# ]

# And you can count how many times each token shows up,
# in bag in order in top to bottom
# (1) John:1,likes:2,... =>  [1,2,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0]
# (2) [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1]
# Above processing is process of converting formation of data,
# to make machine learning algorithm understand data

# You can put tokenized workds into "bag of words",
# in "bigram" way by n-gram methodology,
# and it's shown below
# [
#     "John likes",
#     "likes to",
#     "to watch",

#     "Mary likes",

#     "movies too",
# ]

# You extract tokens by regular expression
# Since you can convert all alphabet characters into lowercase,
# all words like "good,Good,gOod" will be identical into "good"
