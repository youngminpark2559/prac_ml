032. Converting image into vector by hash function<br/>
<xmp>
@
# Average hash expresses image as hash value which can be compared to other hash value of image
# We use MD5, SHA256, etc as hash function 

@
# We use term of "hash" in 2 ways

# We use term of "hash" for hashtable
# Hashtable means one method of data structure, which stores data based on a pair of key and value like Python's dictionary, JavaScript's object

# We use term of "hash" to call fixed length string as "hash"

@
# Let's learn how to use hash library in Python

import hashlib

m = hashlib.md5()
m.update("StringWhatYouWantToHash")
# I get final hashed string
result = m.digest()

@
# Let's deal with image with hash library

import hashlib

# I open file stream which is automatically closed when task is finished
with open("tower.jpg", "rb") as file:
    # I get binary image represented in string from file
    string = file.read()
    m = hashlib.md5()
    m.update(string)
    result = m.digest()

# The good points of hashed image
# 1. It makes comparison possible to other image by fixed short unique sequence of characters
# 1. A specific image generates unique hash value so hash value can be used when you claim intellecture property


@
# The process of converting image into vector is following
# 1. I reduce size of image to 8*8
# 1. I convert color of image to gray
# 1. I calculate average value from values of all pixels
# 1. If a pixel's darkness is larger than average, I input 1 into that pixel, otherwise I input 0 into corresponding pixel

@
pop install Pillow

@
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# This method takes 2 arguments(filename, size)
def average_hash(fname, size = 16):
    # I use Pillow to load file by file name
    img = Image.open(fname)
    # I convert color of image to gray
    # You can use other options(1 for binary, RGB, RGBA, CMYK) to convert
    img = img.convert('L')
    # I resize image
    img = img.resize((size, size), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    # I extract pixel data
    pixel_data = img.getdata()
    # I convert pixel_data into numpy array
    pixels = np.array(pixel_data)

    # Converted pixel stored in numpy array is 1 dimensional arry
    # [
    #     1 1
    #     1 1
    # ]
    # so it's hard to get clear overview data
    # To resolve this issue, I reshape 1 dimensional array into 2 dimensional array
    # [
    #     [1 1]
    #     [1 1]
    # ]
    # High number represents bright point
    pixels = pixels.reshape((size, size))
    # I find mean value of all pixels
    avg = pixels.mean()
    # If a pixel is larger than avg, 1 is assigned
    diff = 1 * (pixels > avg)
    return diff

# This method converts data into binary hash
def np2hash(n):
    bhash = []
    for nl in ahash.tolist():
        sl = [str(i) for i in nl]
        s2 = "".join(sl)
        i = int(s2, 2) # 이진수를 정수로 변환하기
        bhash.append("%04x" % i)
    return "".join(bhash)

# I use average_hash() with passing tower.jpg
ahash = average_hash('tower.jpg')

# You can reshape 2 dimensinal array into 1 dimensional array
print(ahash.reshape(1,-1))

print(ahash)
print(np2hash(ahash))

@
ahash_1 = average_hash('tower.jpg')
ahash_2 = average_hash('test.png')
a = print(ahash_1.reshape(1,-1))
b = print(ahash_2.reshape(1,-1))

# This compare 2 hashed value and returns true if 2 points are same
print(a != b)
# [
#     [True True False
#     True True False
#     True False False
#     True True False
#     False True False]
# ]
# True is 0 in number
print((a != b).sum())
# 155 means how many points are different
# 155 is called haming distance
# If 2 images have 155 different points out of 16*16=256 pixels, it's fair to say they're different images
