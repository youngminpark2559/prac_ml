006. Login by requests library<br/>
<xmp>
@
# We scraped web data by using built in url library in python
# When you do login, we should use "session" technique
# But since Dealing with "session" only by url library is pretty difficult, we'd better use external module "requests"

@
# pip install requests

@
import requests

# first, you create session instance
session = requests.session()
# and you can use get, post, put, delete methods
# url is url what we want to scrap
# session.get(url)
# session.post(url)
# session.put(url)
# session.delete(url)

@
# You get response instance
response = session.get(url)
# And then, you can use raise_for_status() to actually fire your request
response.raise_for_status()
# And then you can utilize text in response
response.text

@
url = "http://google.com"

session = requests.session()
response = session.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()

print(response.text)

# You can see main page of google
# Encoding and other things are automatically processed by "requests library"

@
# You can make and use an data instance for "appointing data" rather using querystring

url = "http://google.com"
data = 
{
    "a":"10",
    "b":"20"
}

session = requests.session()
# You can pass querystring data in get()
response = session.get(url, data=data)
response.raise_for_status()

print(response.text)

@
# When you encounter some problem with url library, you can resolve 99% of them by this method
# 1. Go to web page
# 1. Open developer tool by F12
# 1. Go to "network" tab
# 1. Check if you can see "recording red light"
# 1. Check if you checked "preserve log"
# 1. If you need, you configure as Doc on the under horizonotal bar

@
# Now, we will try to login
First, try to login directly and see what happens in terms of network

@
# We entered login.html
# We moved to login_proc.php
# We moved to index.html

# We should find the place where we login and it's actually login_proc.php
# And the way to find that place is to check the place ID and password are sent
# When I see login.html, I can't see anything related to ID and password, so I can conclude it's not the place what I'm looking for
# When I see login_proc.php, I can see something related to ID and password in "Form Data" section, I can conclude that login happened at this moment of this page

# So, in conclusion, if you imitate this request of page by using "requests library", you will be able to login in python code

@
# First, you need to grab what information are sent
# And they're following elements

# In "Form Data" section,
# return_url : http://www.hanbit.co.kr/index.html
# m_id : myid
# m-password : yourpassword

# In "General" section,
# request url : http://www.hanbit.co.kr/member/login_proc.php
# request methods : post

@
url = "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/member/login_proc.php"
data = 
{
    "return_url" : "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/index.html",
    "m_id" : "myid",
    "m-password" : "yourpassword"
}

session = requests.session()
response = session.post(url, data=data)
response.raise_for_status()

print(response.text)

@
# Grab e-coin web data in logined page
url = "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/myhanbit/myhanbit.html"
response = session.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()
BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html-parser")
text = soup.select_one(".mileage_section2 span").get_text()
print("your e-coin : ", text)
