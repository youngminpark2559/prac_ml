006. login by using "requests library"
<xmp>
# @
# test.py

# @
# We scraped web data by using built-in url library in python
# When you login, we should use "session" technique
# But since dealing with "session" only by url library is difficult,
# we'd better use external module "requests"

# @
# pip install requests

import requests

url = "http://google.com"
# You can make and use data instance for "appointing data" rather writing manually querystring
data = {
    "a":"10",
    "b":"20"
}

# You create session instance
session = requests.session()
# < and you can use get, post, put, delete methods
# < url : url of site what we want to collect
# < session.get(url)
# < session.post(url)
# < session.put(url)
# < session.delete(url)
# > You get response instance from 'session.get()'
response = session.get(url, data = data)
# And then, you can use raise_for_status() to actually perform your request
response.raise_for_status()
# And then you can utilize text data stored in response object
print(response.text)
# < You can see main page of google
# < Encoding and other things are automatically processed by "requests library"


# When you encounter some problems with get() in url library,
# you can resolve 99% of them by this way
# 1. Go to web page
# 1. Open developer tool
# 1. Go to "network" tab
# 1. Check if you can see "recording red light"
# 1. Check if you checked "preserve log"
# 1. If you need, you configure as 'Doc' on the under horizonotal bar

# Now, we will try to login
# First, try to login directly and see what happens in terms of network

# We entered login.html
# We were moved to login_proc.php
# We were moved to index.html

# We should find place where we logedin and it's actually login_proc.php
# And the way to find that place is to check the place where ID and password are sent
# When I see login.html, I can't see any record related to ID and password,
# so I can conclude it's not the place what I'm looking for
# When I see login_proc.php,
# I can see something related to ID and password in "Form Data" section,
# I can conclude that login happened at this moment of this page

# So, in conclusion, if you imitate this request of page by using "requests library",
# you will be able to login in python

# @
# First, you need to see what information are sent
# And they're following elements

# In "Form Data" section,
# return_url : http://www.hanbit.co.kr/index.html
# m_id : myid
# m-password : yourpassword

# In "General" section,
# request url : http://www.hanbit.co.kr/member/login_proc.php
# request methods : post

# @
url_hanbit = "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/member/login_proc.php"
data_hanbit = {
    "return_url" : "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/index.html",
    "m_id" : "myid",
    "m-password" : "yourpassword"
}

session_hanbit = requests.session()
response_hanbit = session_hanbit.post(url_hanbit, data = data_hanbit)
response_hanbit.raise_for_status()
print(response_hanbit.text)

# @
# Let's grab e-coin data from logedin page
url_ecoin = "http://www.hanbit.co.kr/myhanbit/myhanbit.html"
response_ecoin = session.get(url_ecoin)
response_ecoin.raise_for_status()
BeautifulSoup(response_ecoin.text, "html.parser")
# class mileage_section2, descendant tag span
text_ecoin = soup.select_one(".mileage_section2 span").get_text()
print("your e-coin : ", text_ecoin)
