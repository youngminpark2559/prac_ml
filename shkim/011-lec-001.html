011-lec-001. basic of cnn
<xmp>
@
Suppose we have image(32*32*3)
one element represents one value

First of all, we process only partial area of image
Suppose we have filter(5*5*3)
Filter creates one number

Just imagine we have 5 input values $$$x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}$$$
And we use Wx+b formular to create 'one number'
$$$\hat{y}=w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}+w_{3}x_{3}+w_{4}x_{4}+w_{5}x_{5}+b$$$
Here, all weights are elements of filter

We also can use relu
ReLu(Wx+b)

We slide filter along with other elements of image

@
Then, think of how many numbers we can get from sliding filter
Figuring out this numbers are important when defining shape of weight, building model

@
Suppose 7*7 image, 3*3 filter, 1 stride
Shape of output is 5*5  

Suppose 7*7 image, 3*3 filter, 2 stride
Shape of output is 3*3  

Generalization
((7-3)/2)+1

@
As we perform sliding filter, image becomes smaller and smaller
which means we lose data of image
To resolve this, we use 'padding' when we use cnn

Padding is putting 0 along with most outter area
There are 2 benefits of padding
1. Padding prevents losing image data rapidly
1. Padding makes us know most outter area of image

7*7 image, 3*3 filter, 1 stride, 1 pixel pad
7*7->9*9 image
((9-3)/1)+1=7, therefore 7*7
This means our raw image is 7*7 and output image is also 7*7

@
Sliding filter1 -> output1
Sliding filter2 -> output2
...
Sliding filter6 -> output6

shape of entire output: (28,28,6)
28,28: using this formular ((9-3)/1)+1=7
6: number of filters
