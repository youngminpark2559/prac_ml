# @
# Since matplotlib was released long time ago '90s,
# so its design looks old fashion

# After matplotlib, many visualization libraries was released

# There are most neat visualization libraries
# 1. Seaborn
# 1. Bokeh
# 1. Folium

# @
# Seaborn was built based on matplotlib

# Bokeh is python visualization library,
# which is especially useful on web browser
# Bokeh exports plot into html file

# Folium is built based on leaflet.js,
# which is especially useful for geographical visualization

# You can perform geographical visualization,
# with matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh,
# but you should have many prerequisites for geographical visualization

# Folium resolves these botherings
